## Overview

Iteration 3 successfully integrates Google's Gemini AI into Dwelligence, adding powerful natural language search capabilities and interactive POI queries. This document outlines all the features implemented and how to use them.

---

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. **Search/Ask Mode Toggle in Header**

**Location**: Header SearchBar component

**Description**: Users can now toggle between two search modes:
- **Search Mode** (üîç): Traditional address/neighborhood search with autocomplete
- **Ask Mode** (‚ú®): AI-powered natural language property search

**How to Use**:
1. Click the sparkles icon (‚ú®) in the header to switch to "Ask" mode
2. Type natural language queries like:
   - "2 bedroom apartment near parks under $2500"
   - "Show me houses with short commute by transit"
   - "Find properties near groceries and gyms within my budget"
3. The AI will parse your query, find matching properties, and rank them intelligently

**Implementation Details**:
- Component: `frontend/src/components/Header/SearchBar.jsx`
- New component: `frontend/src/components/Header/AskBar.jsx`
- Uses sparkles icon (SVG path) to indicate AI enhancement
- Smooth transition between modes with visual feedback

---

### 2. **AI Results Tab in Right Panel**

**Location**: Right Panel tabs

**Description**: A new "AI Results" tab appears when you perform an AI search, showing properties ranked by Gemini based on your query.

**Features**:
- **Query Interpretation Banner**: Shows how the AI understood your query
- **Total Results Count**: Displays how many properties matched your criteria
- **AI Reasoning**: Each property includes why it was recommended (stored in `property.aiReason`)
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Properties are sorted by relevance to your query, not just price or commute

**How to Use**:
1. Perform an AI search using the Ask mode
2. The "AI Results" tab will automatically appear and become active
3. Browse properties ranked by AI based on your specific query
4. Click any property to see detailed view

**Implementation Details**:
- Component: `frontend/src/components/RightPanel/RightPanel.jsx`
- Tab component: `frontend/src/components/RightPanel/TabsContainer.jsx`
- Context state: `aiResults`, `aiInterpretation` in AppContext

### 3. **Ask Tab in Detailed Listing View**

**Location**: Property detail view (when you click on a listing)

**Description**: A new "Ask" tab with a chat-like interface where you can ask questions about nearby amenities and POIs for a specific property.

**Features**:
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational UI with message history
- **Example Questions**: Pre-populated suggestions to guide users
- **Google Places Integration**: Uses Google Places API to find real nearby businesses
- **AI-Generated Answers**: Gemini generates natural language responses with specific place names and ratings

**Example Questions**:
- "Are there any coffee shops nearby?"
- "What grocery stores are close?"
- "Where can I find gyms?"
- "Any good restaurants in the area?"
- "Is there a pharmacy nearby?"

**How to Use**:
1. Click on any property to open detailed view
2. Navigate to the "Ask" tab (with sparkles icon)
3. Type your question or click an example question
4. Receive AI-generated answer with specific place recommendations

**Implementation Details**:

## üîß Backend Implementation

### New Files Created

#### 1. **Gemini Service** (`backend/src/services/gemini.js`)

Handles all Gemini API interactions:

**Functions**:
- `parseSearchQuery(query)`: Parses natural language into structured filters
  - Extracts: price range, bedrooms, bathrooms, property type, amenities, transport mode
  - Returns: Structured JSON with search parameters

- `rankProperties(properties, userQuery, workplace)`: AI-based property ranking
  - Considers: query requirements, commute time, price, overall quality
  - Returns: Array of property IDs with reasoning

- `generatePropertySummary(property, nearbyAmenities, commuteInfo)`: Context-aware descriptions
  - Generates: 2-3 sentence lifestyle-focused summaries
  - Includes: Property features, nearby amenities, commute info

- `answerPOIQuery(property, question, nearbyPOIs)`: Natural language POI answers
  - Uses: Google Places API data
  - Generates: Conversational answers with specific place names

#### 2. **Updated Search Routes** (`backend/src/routes/search.js`)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/search/ai`

**Flow**:
1. Parse user query with Gemini
2. Check if transport mode clarity is needed
3. Build database filters from parsed parameters
4. Query properties from database
5. Filter by amenities if specified
6. Calculate commutes if workplace is set
7. Rank properties with Gemini AI
8. Return ranked results with interpretation

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "query": "2 bedroom apartment near parks under $2500",
  "workplace": { "lat": 37.7749, "lng": -122.4194 },
  "filters": {},
  "maxResults": 20
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "interpretation": "Looking for 2-bedroom apartments under $2,500/month near parks",
  "results": [...properties with aiReason...],
  "totalResults": 15,
  "searchParams": {...}
}
```

#### 3. **Updated Properties Routes** (`backend/src/routes/properties.js`)

**New Endpoint**: `POST /api/properties/:id/ask`

**Flow**:
1. Get property details from database
2. Extract search keywords from question
3. Query Google Places API for nearby POIs
4. Use Gemini to generate natural language answer
5. Return answer with top 5 POI references

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "question": "Are there any coffee shops nearby?"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "question": "Are there any coffee shops nearby?",
  "answer": "Yes! There are several great coffee shops near this property. Blue Bottle Coffee is just a 5-minute walk away with a 4.5-star rating, and Ritual Coffee Roasters is nearby as well...",
  "nearbyPOIs": [
    {
      "name": "Blue Bottle Coffee",
      "types": ["cafe", "food"],

## üöÄ How to Test

### Testing AI Search

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Search/Ask Toggle**:
   - Navigate to the app
   - Look for the sparkles icon (‚ú®) next to the search bar
   - Click it to toggle to "Ask" mode
   - Notice the placeholder changes to "Ask me anything..."

4. **Test AI Search**:
   - In Ask mode, type: "2 bedroom apartment under $3000"
   - Press Enter or click the sparkles button
   - Watch for "Analyzing your query with AI..." message
   - See the AI Results tab appear
   - Check the query interpretation banner
   - Verify properties are ranked with AI reasoning

5. **Test POI Query**:
   - Click on any property to open detailed view
   - Navigate to the "Ask" tab (with sparkles icon)
   - Click an example question or type your own
   - Example: "Are there any coffee shops nearby?"
   - Watch for the loading animation (bouncing dots)
   - See the AI-generated answer with specific place names
   - Verify POI details (ratings, addresses) are displayed

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Ambiguous Query**:
   - Query: "properties near parks"
   - Should ask for clarification about transport mode

2. **No Results**:
   - Query: "10 bedroom mansion for $500"
   - Should show empty state with helpful message

3. **No Workplace Set**:
   - Try AI search without setting workplace
   - Should still work but without commute-based ranking

4. **API Errors**:
   - Temporarily invalid Gemini API key
   - Should show graceful error messages

---

## üîë Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `backend/.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

‚úÖ **Status**: Both keys are already configured in your `.env` file.

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Gemini API Rate Limits**:
   - Currently no rate limiting implemented
   - May hit API quotas with heavy use
   - Mitigation: Add caching and request throttling

2. **Google Places API Costs**:
   - Each POI query costs money
   - No caching currently implemented
   - Mitigation: Cache results by property + question hash

3. **Keyword Extraction**:
   - Simple keyword extraction from questions
   - Could be improved with Gemini-based keyword extraction

4. **Error Messages**:
   - Generic error messages in some cases
   - Could provide more specific guidance

---

## üìä API Usage Estimates

For a typical user session:

**AI Search**:
- 1 Gemini API call for query parsing (~1,000 tokens)
- 1 Gemini API call for property ranking (~5,000 tokens)
- Total: ~$0.01 per search

**POI Query**:
- 1 Google Places API call (~$0.02)
- 1 Gemini API call for answer generation (~1,500 tokens, ~$0.003)
- Total: ~$0.023 per question

**Daily Usage Example** (100 users, 5 searches each, 3 POI queries each):
- AI Searches: 500 √ó $0.01 = $5.00
- POI Queries: 300 √ó $0.023 = $6.90
- **Total: ~$11.90/day**
